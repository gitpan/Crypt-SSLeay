NAME
      Crypt::SSLeay - OpenSSL & SSLeay glue that provides LWP https support

SYNOPSIS
      lwp-request https://www.nodeworks.com

DESCRIPTION
    This perl module provides support for the https protocol under LWP, so
    that a LWP::UserAgent can make https GET & HEAD requests.

    The Crypt::SSLeay package contains Net::SSL, which is automatically
    loaded by LWP::Protocol::https on https requests, and provides the
    necessary SSL glue for that module to work via these deprecated modules:

       Crypt::SSLeay::CTX
       Crypt::SSLeay::Conn
       Crypt::SSLeay::X509

    Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide https support
    for the LWP - libwww perl libraries. If you want access to the OpenSSL
    API via perl, check out Sampo's Net::SSLeay.

INSTALL
  OpenSSL

    You must have OpenSSL or SSLeay installed before compiling this module.
    You can get the latest OpenSSL package from:

      http://www.openssl.org

    When installing openssl make sure your config looks like:

      > ./config --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl
     or
      > ./config --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl

     then
      > make
      > make test
      > make install

    This way Crypt::SSLeay will pick up the includes and libraries
    automatically. If your includes end up going into a separate directory
    like /usr/local/include, then you will need to symlink
    /usr/local/openssl/include to /usr/local/include

  Crypt::SSLeay

    The latest Crypt::SSLeay can be found at your nearest CPAN, and also:

      http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/Crypt/

    Once you have downloaded it, Crypt::SSLeay installs easily using the
    make or nmake commands as shown below.

      > perl Makefile.PL
      > make
      > make test
      > make install

      * use nmake for win32

BUILD NOTES
  Symbol Error: __umoddi3 : referenced symbol not found

     Problem:

    On Solaris x86, the default PERL configuration, and preferred, is to use
    the ld linker that comes with the OS, not gcc. Unfortunately during the
    OpenSSL build process, gcc generates in libcrypto.a, from bn_word.c, the
    undefined symbol __umoddi3, which is supposed to be later resolved by
    gcc from libgcc.a

    The system ld linker does not know about libgcc.a by default, so when
    building Crypt::SSLeay, there is a linker error for __umoddi3

     Solution:

    The fix for this symlink your libgcc.a to some standard directory like
    /usr/local/lib, so that the system linker, ld, can find it when building
    Crypt::SSLeay.

NOTES
    Many thanks to Gisle Aas for the original writing of this module and
    many others including libwww for perl. The web will never be the same :)
