$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .18; $DATE="2000-11-25";

- created perl/c destructors for the X509 cert for after its
  fetched by Net::SSL.  Crypt::SSLeay seems to run without
  memory leaks now under LWP and Net::SSL.

- Updated Net::SSL::VERSION, bad version last release.

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .17; $DATE="2000-09-04";

- got rid of an implicit char* conversion compile warnings 
  for SSL_get_cipher

+ random seeding now occurs with RAND_seed() on random data
  from the C call stack, works more consistently than RAND_load_file
  from Ben's patch.

+ integrated patches from Ben Laurie for better error messaging
  and random seed initialization

+ set_cipher_list initialized from $ENV{CRYPT_SSLEAY_CIPHER}
  where before it was initialized from $ENV{SSL_CIPHER}, patch
  from Ben Laurie, so ENV setting not conflict with Apache-SSL

+ tested POST LWP requests and updated documentation indicating
  that such use is supported  

+ net_ssl_test now checks https://www.nodeworks.com by default
  which has high uptime so should be fine.

+ first argument to perl Makefile.pl must be an absolute path
  for it to be used as default OpenSSL build path

+ define PL_sv_undef symbols for older perls that don't support
  it, alias to sv_undef

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .16; $DATE="2000-02-25";

+ = improvement; - = bug fix

- changes sv_undef calls to PL_sv_undef, since sv_undef is no 
  longer supported under the latest dev releases of perl 5.0056

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .15; $DATE="1999-11-23";

+ reordered header includes for ActiveState people, likely
  for easier compiling with perl object.

+ Added support for cranky SSLv3 sites.  These are sites
  that don't acknowledge SSLv23 requests, such as:

	https://www.evergreen-funds.com
	https://ecomm.sella.it

  So now, the module will try connects to SSL servers in 
  this order: SSLv23, SSLv3, SSLv2

  None of the sites that I tested required only SSLv2 connects, 
  but it is there just in case.

+ using the call SSLeay_add_all_algorithms(); instead of
  SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms(), because the latter symbol
  was not defined on one person's installation.

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .14; $DATE="1999-10-03";

+ = improvement; - = bug fix

+ added support for RSAref tweaked OpenSSL

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .12; $DATE="1999-09-13";

+ Converted // style comments to /* */ for build
  support of Sun's native cc

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .11; $DATE="1999-08-16";

+ New connection strategy suggested by OpenSSL list,
  first try connecting with SSLv23.  This negotiates
  the more secure SSL3 first, and then downgrades to
  SSLv2 if first unsuccessful.  For buggy servers that
  can't handle the SSLv23 negotiation, Net::SSL then 
  tries a raw SSLv2 connection.

  This method works for all servers tested, and has
  the advantage of tranmitting data via the most secure
  SSL3 method if available.

+ Connects to buggy SSLv2 sites as well as SSLv3
  sites & normal SSLv2 sites.

  Buggy SSLv2:	https://banking.wellsfargo.com
  SSLv3:	https://www.accountonline.com/CB/MainMenu.idcl
  SSLv2:	https://www.nodeworks.com

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .11; $DATE="1999-08-10";

+ Worked through __umoddi3 undef symbol error 
  for building on Solaris x86.  See README build notes.

+ I try to provide backwards compatible building
  with SSLeay (< v.0.9.2)

+ Will pick up ssl distributions installed at
  /usr/local/openssl, and /usr/local/ssl ... openssl
  headers should be at $SSL_DIR/include/openssl
  for compilation to work, see README for installation hints.

- Added SSL 3.0 support with SSLv3_client_method()
  This method will autonegotiate SSL2 or SSL3,
  and works for web sites that require SSL3

+ Added build support in Makefile.PL for WinNT, MS Visual C++

+ Added support for OpenSSL v.0.9.4

   Release 0.07

   Applied patch from Andreas Gustafsson <gson@araneus.fi> which
   make this module compile on WinNT with ActivePerl and MS Visual C++.
   For others that try to build on this platform, Andreas also said:

      "In addition to making these source changes, I also had to
      resort to editing the MakeMaker-generated makefile by hand to
      fix various library paths.  Unfortunately, I am not familiar
      enough with either MakeMaker or NT to provide a clean fix for
      this problem."



1998-01-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.06 and 0.05
   
   Fixed test script t/ssl_context.t
   
   SSL->connect can return 0.  Fixed bug in Net::SSL

   Mention depreciation in the README.  Eric's version of the SSLeay
   glue will replace this module (as well as Sampo Kellomaki's Net::SSLeay).
