+ = improvement; - = bug fix

+ New connection strategy suggested by OpenSSL list,
  first try connecting with SSLv23.  This negotiates
  the more secure SSL3 first, and then downgrades to
  SSLv2 if first unsuccessful.  For buggy servers that
  can't handle the SSLv23 negotiation, Net::SSL then 
  tries a raw SSLv2 connection.

  This method works for all servers tested, and has
  the advantage of tranmitting data via the most secure
  SSL3 method if available.

+ Connects to buggy SSLv2 sites as well as SSLv3
  sites & normal SSLv2 sites.

  Buggy SSLv2:	https://banking.wellsfargo.com
  SSLv3:	https://www.accountonline.com/CB/MainMenu.idcl
  SSLv2:	https://www.nodeworks.com

  To connect to sites that require only SSLv2, the 
  Net::SSL first tries a connect to the site via
  SSLv2, with buggy server options on.  

  This connect will fail for sites that require SSLv3,
  so Net::SSL will then try a connect with SSLv3.

  The order tried is SSLv2 first, then SSLv3, with the 
  assumption that most https servers accept SSLv2 connections,
  and only a minority accept SSLv3 only.

  This could easily be switched around to trying SSLv3 first,
  but when testing this approach it seems that buggy SSLv2 
  only servers hang on the SSLv3 negotiation, while SSLv3 only
  servers reject SSLv2 negotiation immediately, so for now
  it makes sense to try SSLv2 first, then SSLv3.

  SSLv23 was tried to resolve this situation, but it doesn't
  work on some SSLv2 only sites.

1999-08-10   Joshua Chamas <joshua@chamas.com>

+ Worked through __umoddi3 undef symbol error 
  for building on Solaris x86.  See README build notes.

+ I try to provide backwards compatible building
  with SSLeay (< v.0.9.2)

+ Will pick up ssl distributions installed at
  /usr/local/openssl, and /usr/local/ssl ... openssl
  headers should be at $SSL_DIR/include/openssl
  for compilation to work, see README for installation hints.

- Added SSL 3.0 support with SSLv3_client_method()
  This method will autonegotiate SSL2 or SSL3,
  and works for web sites that require SSL3

+ Added build support in Makefile.PL for WinNT, MS Visual C++

+ Added support for OpenSSL v.0.9.4

   Release 0.07

   Applied patch from Andreas Gustafsson <gson@araneus.fi> which
   make this module compile on WinNT with ActivePerl and MS Visual C++.
   For others that try to build on this platform, Andreas also said:

      "In addition to making these source changes, I also had to
      resort to editing the MakeMaker-generated makefile by hand to
      fix various library paths.  Unfortunately, I am not familiar
      enough with either MakeMaker or NT to provide a clean fix for
      this problem."



1998-01-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.06 and 0.05
   
   Fixed test script t/ssl_context.t
   
   SSL->connect can return 0.  Fixed bug in Net::SSL
   


1998-01-12   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.04

   Mention depreciation in the README.  Eric's version of the SSLeay
   glue will replace this module (as well as Sampo Kellomaki's Net::SSLeay).
