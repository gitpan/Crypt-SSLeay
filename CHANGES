$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .33; $DATE="2001-10-31";

 + = improvement; - = bug fix

+ Documented differences / conflicts between LWP proxy support
  and Crypt::SSLeay which seems to be a source of confusion for users.

+ Added Net::SSL::get_peer_verify call so the warning header
  from LWP that says:

    Client-SSL-Warning: Peer certificate not verified

  can be suppressed when HTTPS_CA_FILE & HTTPS_CA_DIR environment
  variables are set to invoke peer certificate verification.
  I will submit patch for perl-libwww 5.6 for this support
  of get_peer_verify shortly.

  Modified return values of $ctx->set_verify() to return 1 when
  peer verification is enabled to support get_peer_verify()

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .31; $DATE="2001-09-21";

+ $ENV{HTTPS_DEBUG} activates Crypt::SSLeay specific debugging,
  so one can debug from LWP:: calls without using ./net_ssl_test script

+ $ENV{CRYPT_SSLEAY_DEFAULT} may now be set to trigger --default
  functionality for Makefile.PL

+ Added --default switch to Makefile.PL which will pick
  up the first OpenSSL distribution detected and use that
  for building Crypt::SSLeay. Inspired by Doug MacEachern

- removed exit from Makefile.PL, bug found by Doug MacEachern

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .29; $DATE="2001-06-29";

+ Streamlined *CA* patches so only in $CTX->set_verify()
  which gets called every time now.

+ Throw error instead of return undef in Net::SSL->connect()
  because we loose the errors otherwise.  Applications
  working with Net::SSL will have to trap calls around
  Net::SSL->connect with eval {}.  There are so many 
  kinds of errors now, especially with certificate
  support that we really need to throw specific error
  messages, and not let them get lost in $!.

- Turn SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY on so clients can survive
  changes in SSLVerifyClient changes in the modssl connection

  Comment from source:
	   /* The set mode is necessary so the SSL connection can
  	    * survive a renegotiated cipher that results from 
	    * modssl VerifyClient config changing between 
	    * VirtualHost & some other config block.  At modssl
	    * this would be a [trace] ssl message:
	    *  "Changed client verification type will force renegotiation"
  #ifdef SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY
	   SSL_set_mode(ssl, SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY);
  #endif

  Seems like openssl 0.9.4 didn't need this but 0.9.6 does,
  not sure though.

+ Integrated patches from Gamid Isayev for CA peer
  verification.  New settings include:

  $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} = "some_file";
  $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR}  = "some_dir";

  Also create config switches for these in ./net_ssl_test,
  -CAfile and -CAdir

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .27; $DATE="TBA";

- Client certs weren't working correctly, setup certs
  earlier in connection now, also create new CTX per
  request, so cert settings don't remain sticky from
  one request to the next.

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .25; $DATE="2001-04-10";

+ update ./net_ssl_test to do smart parsing of host, where
  host can now be of the form http://www.nodeworks.com:443/

+ integrated client cert patches provided by Tobias Manthey,
  creating new config options:

    $ENV{HTTPS_CERT_FILE}  -- file of client certificate
    $ENV{HTTPS_KEY_FILE}   -- file of private key file

  Also support for these options in ./net_ssl_test with these
  options:
 
  -cert  client certificate file
  -key   private key file

  like so:

    ./net_ssl_test -cert=notacacert.pem -key=notacakeynopass.pem -d

  To create simple test cert with openssl:

     /usr/local/openssl/bin/openssl req -config /usr/local/openssl/openssl.cnf -new -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 -keyout notacakey.pem -out notacacert.pem 
     /usr/local/openssl/bin/openssl rsa -in notacakey.pem -out notacakeynopass.pem

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .24; $DATE="2001-03-09";

 + = improvement; - = bug fix

- local $@ in Net::SSL::DESTROY so we don't kill real errors

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .23; $DATE="2001-03-09";

+ added lwp-ssl-test file for showing LWP code use

+ added -h/-help options & docs to ./net_ssl_test script

+ updated alpha linux patch from Alex Rhomberg to what 
  he originally provided, as it covered -lots case better.

- return undef in Net::SSL::connect() instead of die()
  for better LWP support & error handling.  Still set
  $@ though, consistent with IO::Socket::INET

+ alarm() on Unix platforms around ssl ctx connect, which
  can hang for process for way too long when trying to 
  connect to dead https SSL servers.

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .22; $DATE="2001-01-29";

- remove // style comments

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .21; $DATE="2001-01-10";

- AIX build notes correction

+ No reverse lookup for host done for proxying, more 
  efficient.  Reuse of cached PeerAddr name from Net::SSL->new

+ $ENV{HTTPS_VERSION} setting, so a SSL v3 connection can
  be used first, instead of SSLv23.  Documented in README,pod.
  Added support for this to the test program as:
    
     ./net_ssl_test -v[ersion] 3 

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .19; $DATE="2001-01-07";

+ Added runtime SSL debugging support, was compile time before.
  Trigger with Net::SSL->new(..., SSL_Debug => 1) as in 
  the ./net_ssl_test script run with -d argument.  No
  API for debugging from LWP requests, just for https
  debugging with ./net_ssl_test really.

+ Added support for proxy via $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = 
  proxy_host:proxy_port.  Thanks to Bryan Hart for the patch.
  Also basic auth support added & documented.

+ alpha linux ccc support with -lots library added for compile.
  Patch from Alex Rhomberg.

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .18; $DATE="2000-11-25";

- created perl/c destructors for the X509 cert for after its
  fetched by Net::SSL.  Crypt::SSLeay seems to run without
  memory leaks now under LWP and Net::SSL.

- Updated Net::SSL::VERSION, bad version last release.

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .17; $DATE="2000-09-04";

- got rid of an implicit char* conversion compile warnings 
  for SSL_get_cipher

+ random seeding now occurs with RAND_seed() on random data
  from the C call stack, works more consistently than RAND_load_file
  from Ben's patch.

+ integrated patches from Ben Laurie for better error messaging
  and random seed initialization

+ set_cipher_list initialized from $ENV{CRYPT_SSLEAY_CIPHER}
  where before it was initialized from $ENV{SSL_CIPHER}, patch
  from Ben Laurie, so ENV setting not conflict with Apache-SSL

+ tested POST LWP requests and updated documentation indicating
  that such use is supported  

+ net_ssl_test now checks https://www.nodeworks.com by default
  which has high uptime so should be fine.

+ first argument to perl Makefile.pl must be an absolute path
  for it to be used as default OpenSSL build path

+ define PL_sv_undef symbols for older perls that don't support
  it, alias to sv_undef

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .16; $DATE="2000-02-25";

- changes sv_undef calls to PL_sv_undef, since sv_undef is no 
  longer supported under the latest dev releases of perl 5.0056

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .15; $DATE="1999-11-23";

+ reordered header includes for ActiveState people, likely
  for easier compiling with perl object.

+ Added support for cranky SSLv3 sites.  These are sites
  that don't acknowledge SSLv23 requests, such as:

	https://www.evergreen-funds.com
	https://ecomm.sella.it

  So now, the module will try connects to SSL servers in 
  this order: SSLv23, SSLv3, SSLv2

  None of the sites that I tested required only SSLv2 connects, 
  but it is there just in case.

+ using the call SSLeay_add_all_algorithms(); instead of
  SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms(), because the latter symbol
  was not defined on one person's installation.

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .14; $DATE="1999-10-03";

+ = improvement; - = bug fix

+ added support for RSAref tweaked OpenSSL

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .12; $DATE="1999-09-13";

+ Converted // style comments to /* */ for build
  support of Sun's native cc

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .11; $DATE="1999-08-16";

+ New connection strategy suggested by OpenSSL list,
  first try connecting with SSLv23.  This negotiates
  the more secure SSL3 first, and then downgrades to
  SSLv2 if first unsuccessful.  For buggy servers that
  can't handle the SSLv23 negotiation, Net::SSL then 
  tries a raw SSLv2 connection.

  This method works for all servers tested, and has
  the advantage of tranmitting data via the most secure
  SSL3 method if available.

+ Connects to buggy SSLv2 sites as well as SSLv3
  sites & normal SSLv2 sites.

  Buggy SSLv2:	https://banking.wellsfargo.com
  SSLv3:	https://www.accountonline.com/CB/MainMenu.idcl
  SSLv2:	https://www.nodeworks.com

$MODULE=Crypt::SSLeay; $VERSION = .11; $DATE="1999-08-10";

+ Worked through __umoddi3 undef symbol error 
  for building on Solaris x86.  See README build notes.

+ I try to provide backwards compatible building
  with SSLeay (< v.0.9.2)

+ Will pick up ssl distributions installed at
  /usr/local/openssl, and /usr/local/ssl ... openssl
  headers should be at $SSL_DIR/include/openssl
  for compilation to work, see README for installation hints.

- Added SSL 3.0 support with SSLv3_client_method()
  This method will autonegotiate SSL2 or SSL3,
  and works for web sites that require SSL3

+ Added build support in Makefile.PL for WinNT, MS Visual C++

+ Added support for OpenSSL v.0.9.4 

1998-10-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 0.07

   Applied patch from Andreas Gustafsson <gson@araneus.fi> which
   make this module compile on WinNT with ActivePerl and MS Visual C++.
   For others that try to build on this platform, Andreas also said:

      "In addition to making these source changes, I also had to
      resort to editing the MakeMaker-generated makefile by hand to
      fix various library paths.  Unfortunately, I am not familiar
      enough with either MakeMaker or NT to provide a clean fix for
      this problem."
